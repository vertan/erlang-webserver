erlang-webserver
================

A simple thread-based web server written in Erlang written as a learning project.

What this is
------------

* A web server with basic functionality
* A beginner project in development (I'm always open for tips and suggestions!)
* Not optimal!

Usage
-----

Compile webserver.erl with the erlang compiler at your own chosen way.
For example, using the erlang shell:

1. Start the shell

2. Go to the folder containing webserver.erl using ```cd("your/chosen/directory").```

3. Compile the file using the c command ```c(webserver).```

4. Start the server by giving the command ```webserver:start().```
